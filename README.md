# Final Pedestrian Classification

This repository contains a project focused on classifying pedestrians using machine learning techniques. The codebase is primarily Jupyter Notebooks, with some supporting Python scripts.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to develop, train, and evaluate models that can accurately classify pedestrians in images. The workflow typically involves:
- Loading and preprocessing image data
- Building and training machine learning or deep learning models
- Evaluating and visualizing model performance

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks/**: Main Jupyter Notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation
- **Python Scripts**: Helper scripts for data processing or utilities
- **Data/** *(not included)*: Place datasets here if needed

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cortesb3/Final_Pedestrian_Classification.git
    cd Final_Pedestrian_Classification
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
    Most requirements can be installed via pip. Typical packages include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If there is no requirements.txt, install standard ML/data science packages as needed.)*

3. **Run the notebooks**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the desired notebook to explore code and results.

## Usage

- Modify and run the Jupyter Notebooks to train and evaluate pedestrian classification models on your data.
- Results, analysis, and visualizations are available within the notebooks.
